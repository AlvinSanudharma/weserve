## Alternative (using VSCode Live Server)

If you are using **VSCode**, make sure you install the **Live Server** extension first:

1. Open the **Extensions Marketplace** in VSCode.
2. Search for **"Live Server"** (by Ritwick Dey) and install it.
3. Right-click the `index.html` file â†’ select **Open with Live Server**.
4. The website will automatically run at `http://localhost:5500/` or another default port.
